- 🤓  Strategist turned **Full Stack Developer**, after graduating from [Le Wagon's Ruby on Rails Bootcamp](https://github.com/lewagon).
- 🦠 I've participated in the creation of [Covidliste](https://github.com/hostolab/covidliste), matching people who wish to be vaccinated with health vaccination centers.
- 💚  I’m currently working at [Pennylane](https://github.com/pennylane-hq).
- 👩🏻‍🏫  I'm also teaching at [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon).
