### Hi there 👋

- 🤓  Strategist turned **Full Stack Developer**, I recently graduated from [Le Wagon's Ruby on Rails Bootcamp](https://github.com/lewagon).
- 🦠 I've participated in the creation of [Covidliste](https://github.com/hostolab/covidliste), matching people who wish to be vaccinated with health vaccination centers.
- 🔭  I’m currently working on an RoR app helping you to go through pregnancy.
- 👩🏻‍🏫  I am also teaching at Le Wagon.
- 🐙 ... and just know that I am fascinated by jellyfishes and addicted to crosswords 💕
